# HTML and CSS Module 3

## Task 3.4

### Brief

Use media queries to change the Guitar Kings website to be responsive across screen sizes.

We have only given you a desktop prototype to work with, so there might be some differences in styling, but essentially we want the website to look good at every screen size. For example, if you have a three column layout that is squashed on tablet and mobile, then change it to be two columns on tablet and one column on mobile.

Here is the result of our updates to the site on mobile
